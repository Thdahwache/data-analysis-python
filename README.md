# data-analysis-python
 A repository to keep track of my freeCodeCamp codes for the Data Analysis with Python course. The first project, the calculator, doesn't have a notebook associated with it, because wasn't needed, the other four, however, were made using first the Notebook and the coding in the respective .py, so feel free to see both ou just the notebook (which include more analysis and is more complete).


## Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

A simple calculator for Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation using the Numpy library. The mean_var_std.py contains the code for the calculate() and the main.py is used for debugging.

## Demographic Data Analyzer

This project is focused on the use of Pandas and Numpy to analyze demographic data from some countries and give answer to the questios proposed (All the questions are shown in the readme inside the folder). For a better visualization, the Jupyter Notebook contains all the transformation that was used divided by the respective question.


## Medical Data Visualizer

In this visualization project, i used medical data to explore the correlation between provided healthy info and the cardio disease. The work was made using matplotlib, seaborn and pandas.

## Page View Time Series Visualizer

Applying now visualization in a time series, this project used the data from freeCodeCamp forum (Page Views) to the student get in touch with different kinds of plots, using pandas, matplot and seaborn libraries.

## Sea Level Predictor

The last project involved working with line regression prediction. The data for the work was the sea level from 1880 to 2020, which would help to predict the sea level in 2050.
